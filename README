1) INTRODUCTION

    This handy little DOS-based utility takes a file containing several lines
    of text and outputs those same lines to the screen or another file in
    random order.

    This program began after having a conversation with a friend who wanted
    to know if there was a way to do such a thing on a Windows machine. After
    explaining that there wasn't, the problem siezed me and I spent an hour
    hacking something together and mailed him a copy.  He was surprised and
    pleased, but that wasn't the end of the story.  I wasn't happy with how
    the randomizing was being done and so spent a couple of days obsessed
    with how to mix up an array as efficiently as possible but still maintain
    a nice, smoothly random distribution.  This is the end result, with a
    little documentation thrown in.


2) SYNTAX

    The syntax is as follows:

        ANTISORT infile [outfile]

    where

        infile        Specifies the file containing the lines to be
                      randomized.
        outfile       (optional) Specifies the name of a file to put the
                      randomized lines into.  If omitted, output will be to
                      the screen.

3) EXAMPLES

    ANTISORT VALUES.TXT

        Outputs the lines from the file VALUES.TXT to the screen in random
	order.


    ANTISORT VALUES.TXT MIXED_UP.TXT

        Outputs the lines from the file VALUES.TXT to the file MIXED_UP.TXT
	in random order. If MIXED_UP.TXT does not exist it will be created.
	If it does exist, it will be overwritten without prompting.


4) INSTALLATION

    Just copy all the files from this archive into a subdirectory.  To
    uninstall, simply delete them (ANTISORT doesn't require or create any
    .INI files, registry entries, data files, etc).  You might want to put
    ANTISORT.EXE in your path (C:\DOS or C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND).


5) KNOWN BUGS

    ANTISORT doesn't choke on binary files, but it doesn't do anything
    useful.  Please feed it ASCII text only.

    Though it's not really a bug, if the output file you specify already
    exists, it will be overwritten without prompting.  The program also
    doesn't check to see if your input file and output file are the same.
    If they are, things work as expected: the input file is replaced with
    a scrambled version and the original version is lost.

    Also not really a bug is that ANTISORT won't work on really huge files.
    This is because the nature of randomizing lines pretty much requires that
    the whole file be loaded into memory at one time.  Technically, the
    limiting factor is some combination of the number of lines and the
    absolute size of the file.  For example, my computer had no problem
    mixing up a file of over three million lines if the file was no more than
    a few megabytes.  It also easily handled a 40MB file with 500,000 lines.
    But a 60MB file nearly killed my machine due to disk thrashing when
    trying to write out the randomized file.  And a file with five million
    lines bombed out with an "Out Of Memory" error even though it was under
    50MB. The moral of the story is, if you need to randomize lines in a file
    with more than a few million lines or more than 50MB in size, you'll
    either need a better machine than mine or a different utility.

    If you enjoy this program, I'd appreciate it if you drop me a line
    saying so.  Please send any bug reports to me, as well.

    I wrote this program for my own education and to help out a friend, and
    have made it available thinking that perhaps there are others who would
    find it useful.  I do not need or expect any money from you if you use
    it; this is freeware in every sense of the word.  However, if you really
    feel you should send me money, I guess that'd be okay, too.

    Thanks for using my program.


7) VERSION HISTORY/CHANGES

    0.4b         fourth release             6 July 2001

        changes from v 0.3b to 0.4b

        + fixed a stupid bug where ANTISORT would quit reading lines of
          input once a blank line was encountered

    0.3b         third release              4 June 2001

        changes from v 0.2b to 0.3b

        + rewrote input routines to handle lines without terminating newline
        + further reduced memory footprint (so you should be able to sort
          even longer/larger files now)
        + sped up input and output
        + now correctly handles zero-length files

    0.2b         second release             1 June 2001

        changes from v 0.1b to 0.2b

        + completely rewrote the "sort", speeding things up by as much as
          130x (!) for large files
        + reduced memory footprint
        + added ability to specify output file on the command-line
        + now licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
        + source code now included in archive
        + added documentation

    0.1b         initial release           30 May 2001
